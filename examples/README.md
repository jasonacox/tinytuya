# TinyTuya - Examples

Code examples using `tinytuya` module to control various Tuya devices.

## Read Tuya Device Status

[getstatus.py](getstatus.py) - This script will read the status of a Tuya device. 

## Smart Bulb (RGB) 

[bulb.py](bulb.py) - This script tests controlling Smart Bulb with RGB capabilities.  

[bulb-scenes.py](bulb-scenes.py) - This script tests out setting Scenes for the smart bulb 

Tested devices:  Peteme Smart Light Bulbs, Wi-Fi - [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MKDLV1V/)

[galaxy_projector.py](galaxy_projector.py) This script tests controlling a Galaxy Projector from [galaxylamps.co](https://eu.galaxylamps.co/collections/all/products/galaxy-projector)

## Continuous Monitor

[monitor.py](monitor.py) - This script uses a loop to listen to a Tuya device for any state changes.  

## Non-blocking Send and Receive

[non_blocking_send_receive.py](non_blocking_send_receive.py) - This demonstrates how you can make a persistent connection to a Tuya device, send commands and monitor for responses without blocking.

## Send Raw DPS Values

[send_raw_dps.py](send_raw_dps.py) - This script show how to send and set raw DPS values on a Tuya device. 

## Scan all Devices

[devices.py](devices.py) - Poll status of all devices in `devices.json`.

## Use snapshot.json to Manage Devices

[snapshot.py](snapshot.py) - Example of using `snapshot.json` to manage Tuya Devices

```python
# Load in snapshot.py and control by name
turn_off('Dining Room')
time.sleep(2)
turn_on('Dining Room')
```

## Tuya Cloud API Examples

[cloud.py](cloud.py) -  Example that uses the Tinytuya `Cloud` class and functions to access the Tuya Cloud API to pull device information and control the device via the cloud.

## Multi-Threaded Example

[multi-threading.py](multi-threading.py) - Example that uses python threading to connect to multiple devices and listen for updates.

## Multiple Device Select Example

[multi-select.py](multi-select.py) - Example that uses python select() to connect to multiple devices and listen for updates simultaneously. By using select(), the program avoids having to create separate threads for each device and can efficiently handle multiple device connections in a single loop.
